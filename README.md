# 👋 Hey, I'm Jon

I'm Head of Product at [Expo](https://expo.dev), where we make tools for building apps. Previously, I was a front-end engineer at Codecademy.

I work across design and engineering, and I'm motivated by making it easier for anyone to build apps.

### Projects

A few projects I've made with React Native & Expo:

- 📸 [QRU?](https://github.com/jonsamp/qru) — a QR code scanning app
- 🎲 [Word Check](https://github.com/jonsamp/word-check) — a Scrabble word validator
- ☕ [Single Origin](https://github.com/jonsamp/single-origin-two) — a pour-over coffee timer
