# 👋 Hey, I'm Jon

I'm Head of Product at [Expo](https://expo.dev), where we make tools for building apps. Previously, I was a front-end engineer at Codecademy.

I work across design and engineering, and I'm motivated by making it easier for anyone to build apps.

### Projects

A few projects I've made with React Native & Expo:
